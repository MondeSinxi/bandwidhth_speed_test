# Bandwidth Speed Test

Here we use speetest.net's Python API to get the download and upload speed of my home network. I've set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes.
I'll use Streamlit to expose data as single page web application. 

## Motivation
Hopefully we can gather enough data to analyze bandwidth speeds at a particular time and see if there are any underlying patterns to see the stability of the network.
This project was started during the Level 4 lockdown period, so this will by no means provide a baseline of the performance of my network under normal circumstances.
